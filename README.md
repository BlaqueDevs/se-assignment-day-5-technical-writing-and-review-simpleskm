## 1. How can understanding your audience’s expertise level (tech experts vs. regular folks) shape the way you present technical information?
.**Language and Terminology**
**Tech Experts:** Use industry-specific jargon and technical terms without extensive explanations. Experts appreciate precision and detail.
**Regular Folks:** Simplify language and avoid jargon. Use analogies and everyday examples to explain complex concepts.
 **Depth of Information**
**Tech Experts:** Provide in-depth analysis, detailed data, and comprehensive explanations. Experts are interested in the “how” and “why” behind the information.
**Regular Folks:** Focus on the big picture and key takeaways. Highlight the practical implications and benefits without overwhelming them with details.
 **Presentation Style**
**Tech Experts:** Use technical diagrams, charts, and data visualizations. Experts can interpret and appreciate detailed visual aids.
**Regular Folks:** Use simple visuals, infographics, and step-by-step guides. Ensure that visuals are easy to understand and support the main points.
 **Purpose and Goals**
**Tech Experts:** Aim to inform, discuss, or collaborate on technical solutions. Experts are often looking for detailed insights to apply in their work.
**Regular Folks:** Aim to educate, persuade, or inform about the practical benefits. Regular folks are more interested in how the information affects them directly.
